We're excited to announce significant enhancements to our Fee Estimation system! Our latest update introduces a more dynamic approach to handling transaction fees, especially designed to adapt to varying network conditions.

- **Adaptive Fee Estimations:** Our system now better recognises network congestion, adjusting fees accordingly to maximize the likelihood of your transactions being processed smoothly.
- **Uninterrupted Performance:** These improvements are designed to work seamlessly, ensuring that standard transaction activities remain unaffected, even during periods of high traffic.

You can enjoy a more reliable transaction experience on our platform, even during busy times.
