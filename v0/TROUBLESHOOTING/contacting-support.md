## Discharge of Responsibility

You must keep your `privateKey`(s) and `mnemonics`/seed phrases confidential and secure at all times. Sharing this information with anyone can result in serious consequences such as the loss of your funds. Your private keys and mnemonics give full access to your funds, and once they are shared, you lose control over your assets. 

No legitimate `Tatum staff member` will ever ask for your private keys or mnemonics. If you are asked for this information, it is most likely a scam attempt and you should immediately report it. Your security is of the utmost importance, and we highly encourage you to never share your private keys or mnemonics with anyone, under any circumstances.

> ðŸš§ It is your responsibility to safeguard your Private Keys and mnemonics/seed phrases and protect them from unauthorized access.
