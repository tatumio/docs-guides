When you sign up in the [Tatum.io Dashboard](https://dashboard.tatum.io/login), you'll get one development (Testnet) Auth API key and one for production (Mainnet) API key. You can create more API keys as you need them.

- **Mainnet** stands for "main network". This is where your production app will run.
- **Testnet** stands for "testing network". In most cases, has the same features and characteristics as the mainnet. The Testnet blockchain is completely isolated from the Mainnet blockchain. It doesn't have the same data, and it doesn't guarantee data persistence. On the other hand, all operations on the Testnet are free. This makes Testnet a great environment for developing and testing apps.

> ğŸš§ All **Mainnet** transactions are final. If you send assets like BTC to the wrong address over Testnet it's fine since Testnet assets hold no value. However, if this happens in Mainnet, you'll lose real money!
