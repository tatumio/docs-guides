In the ever-expanding world of blockchain, keeping track of non-fungible token (NFT) transactions is crucial for maintaining a secure and efficient platform. Tatum's INCOMING_NFT_TX notification type offers a powerful solution to help you stay informed about incoming non-fungible token transactions (e.g., ERC-721 / SPL transfers) involving a specific address.

> ðŸ“˜ Hint
> 
> A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of a one-of-a-kind item or piece of content, such as digital art, virtual real estate, or collectibles. Unlike fungible tokens, NFTs are not interchangeable and each NFT has a distinct value based on its rarity, provenance, and the demand for that specific token.
> 
> There are different NFT standards, most known are ERC-721 on EVM chains or SPL

    const monitoredAddress = '0xF64E82131BE01618487Da5142fc9d289cbb60E9d'
    
    const subscription = await tatum.notification.subscribe.incomingNftTx({
        address: monitoredAddress,
        url: 'https://<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>' // replace with your handler URL
    })
    console.log(`Now you will be notified about all incoming NFT transactions on ${monitoredAddress}`)
})()
