A wallet, in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, is a digital tool that allows users to securely store, manage, and transact with their digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens. Wallets come in various forms, including hardware, software, and even paper wallets. The primary function of a wallet is to securely store a user's private keys, which are needed to access and manage their assets on the blockchain.
