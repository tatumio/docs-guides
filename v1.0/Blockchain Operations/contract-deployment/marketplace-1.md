Peer-to-peer NFT marketplaces like OpenSea allow users to create NFTs with metadata (pictures, videos, songs, 3D art, etc.) and post listings to sell them to one another. OpenSea then takes a percentage of each sale.

If you want to build a backend for your own peer-to-peer NFT marketplace, youâ€™ll definitely want to implement the same functionality.

Creating NFTs has always been super simple with Tatum. But now, you can also create NFT marketplaces and listings using just a few API calls! When the NFT is sold, the creator is automatically paid, the NFT is instantly transferred to the buyer, and you as the owner of the marketplace automatically receive a percentage of the transaction. Everything happens on the blockchain, so you donâ€™t even need to create a complex, application-level backend to run the listings.

Deploy an NFT marketplace smart contract on the blockchain. With a deployed marketplace smart contract, you and your customers can create new listings for assets such as non-fungible tokens and combinations of token types as described by the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards on the Ethereum blockchain or by the equivalent standards on the other blockchains. As the marketplace operator, you can set a fee as a percentage of the asset price that will be paid on top of the asset price.
