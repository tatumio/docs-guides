This Tatum service enables you to deploy a smart contract on the blockchain. You can create the following types of contracts:

- **ERC-20 - Fungible token like USDT**  
  This contract allows users to create and manage their own fungible tokens on EVM blockchains
- **ERC-721 - NFT collection like BAYC**  
  This contract enables the creation and management of unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on EVM blockchains
- **ERC-1155 - MultiToken NFT collection**  
  This contract provides a more flexible token standard that allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens on EVM blockchains.
