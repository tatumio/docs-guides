excerpt: "<h4>2 credits per API call.</h4><br/>\n<p>Enable accepting Algorand asset on the sender account.<br/><br/>\nThis operation needs the private key of the blockchain address.\nNo one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey\nor signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.\nAlternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.\n</p>"
