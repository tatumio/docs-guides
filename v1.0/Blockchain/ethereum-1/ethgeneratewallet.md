excerpt: "<h4>1 credit per API call.</h4><br/><p>Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. Because they can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase, they are very convenient and secure. A mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in a defined order and can restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.<br/>Each address is identified by 3 main values:<ul><li>Private Key - your secret value which should never be revealed</li><li>Public Key - a public address to be published</li><li>Derivation index - an index of generated address</li></ul></p><p>Tatum follows the BIP44 specification and generates for Ethereum wallets with the derivation path m/44'/60'/0'/0. More about BIP44 HD wallets can be found here - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki</a>.\nGenerates a BIP44 compatible Ethereum wallet.</p>"
