excerpt: "<p><b>1 credit per API call</b></p>\n<p>Get information about a transaction output in a transaction and check whether this output is a UTXO or has been spent.</p>\n<p>\"UTXO\" stands for \"Unspent Transaction Output\". A UTXO is the amount of DOGE that remains at a Dogecoin address after a cryptocurrency transaction involving this address has been performed. The UTXO can then be used as input for a new cryptocurrency transaction. For more information about the UTXO, see the <a href=\"https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin user documentation</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the transaction output is an UTXO, the API returns data about it.</li>\n<li>If the transaction output has been spent and there is no UTXO to return, the API returns an error with the <code>404</code> response code.</li>\n</ul>"
