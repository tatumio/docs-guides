title: "Verify an NFT in an NFT collection on Solana"
slug: "nftverifyincollection"
excerpt: "<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>\n<p>Verify an NFT in an NFT collection on Solana. Verifying an NFT sets the <code>Verified</code> parameter to <code>true</code> for the NFT, which means that the NFT is really a part of the collection. To know more about Solana collections and verification, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/certified-collections\" target=\"_blank\">Solana user documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>The collection must be a sized collection that was introduced in <a href=\"https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/changelog/v1.3\" target=\"_blank\">Version 1.3</a> of the Metaplex Token Metadata program. The NFT must have been <a href=\"#operation/NftMintErc721\">minted in this collection</a>.</p>\n<p>This API is supported only for Solana.</p>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>\nWhen verifying an NFT, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>"
