excerpt: "<p><b>This API is deprecated.<br/>To start with the gas pump, use the <a href=\"#operation/PrecalculateGasPumpAddresses\">API for precalculating the gas pump addresses</a>.</b></p>\n<p><b>If you built your gas pump solution using this API and the <a href=\"#operation/GenerateCustodialWalletBatch\">API for generating a gas pump wallet address</a>, you can still use this API for creating more custodial addresses for your solution. However, we recommend that you switch to the <a href=\"#operation/PrecalculateGasPumpAddresses\">API for precalculating the gas pump addresses</a></b>.</p><br/>\n<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>\n<p>Generate new gas pump smart contract address on the blockchain. It's possible to enable tokens, which should be detected and supported on that address. This address enables custodial providers to\nreceive native assets, ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155 tokens on behalf of their customers on dedicated blockchain address, but in the same time it can initiate transfer of those assets away.</p>\n<p>Gas required for the transfer from that address is going to be deducted from the providers address - the one, which was used to generate the address on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>There are multiple options, how this address can be setup - it cannot be changed in the future:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Native assets only - ETH, BSC, CELO, MATIC, ONE, TRX</li>\n<li>Native assets + ERC20 tokens</li>\n<li>Native assets + ERC721 tokens</li>\n<li>Native assets + ERC1155 tokens - TRON does not support 1155 standard</li>\n<li>Native assets + ERC20 + ERC721 tokens</li>\n<li>Native assets + ERC20 + ERC1155 tokens - TRON does not support 1155 standard</li>\n<li>Native assets + ERC721 + ERC1155 tokens - TRON does not support 1155 standard</li>\n<li>Native assets + ERC20 + ERC721 + ERC1155 tokens - TRON does not support 1155 standard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these options could be enabled with a batch mode as well - in 1 transaction, it is possible to transfer multiple different assets from that address, e.g. ETH + USDC + ERC721 token.\nWithout batch mode, 3 separate transaction must have been performed.</p>\n<p>This operation deploys a smart contract on the blockchain. More assets you will support, more intial gas will be used for address creation. Batch mode adds more gas for every type.</p>\n<p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BNB Smart Chain</li>\n<li>Celo</li>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Harmony</li>\n<li>Polygon</li>\n<li>TRON (except for Multi Tokens)</li>\n</ul>"
