slug: "transfermultitoken"
excerpt: "<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>\n<p>Transfer a certain amount of Multi Token from account to another account. Transfer Multi Tokens token from smart contract defined in contractAddress.</p>\n<p>Only 1 specific token with specified tokenId and value can be transferred. This method invokes ERC1155 method safeTransfer() to transfer the token in case of ETH, Celo and blockchains.</p>\n<p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BNB Smart Chain</li>\n<li>Celo</li>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Harmony</li>\n<li>Klaytn</li>\n<li>KuCoin Community Chain</li>\n<li>Polygon</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b></p>\n<p>When transferring a Multi Token, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>"
