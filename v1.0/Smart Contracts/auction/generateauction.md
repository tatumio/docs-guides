excerpt: "<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>\n<p>Deploy new smart contract for NFT auction logic. Smart contract enables auction operator to create new auction for NFT (ERC-721/1155).\nOperator can set a fee in percentage, which will be paid on top of the price of the asset.\ncan be offered for native asset - ETH, BSC, etc. - or any ERC20 token - this is configurable during auction creation.\nBefore auction is created, seller must approve transfer of the NFT to the auction contract.\nBuyer will bid for the asset from the auction using native asset - send assets along the gid() smart contract call, or via ERC20 token.\nBuyer of the auction must perform approval for the smart contract to access ERC20 token, before the actual bid() method is called.\nOnce there is higher bid then the actual one, the previous bidder's funds will be returned to him and new bidder will be the current winning one.\nWhen auction ends, anyone can settle the auction - NFT will be sent to the bidder, assets to the seller and fee to the operator.<br/>\nThis operation deploys a smart contract on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BNB Smart Chain</li>\n<li>Celo</li>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Harmony</li>\n<li>Klaytn</li>\n<li>Polygon</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>\nWhen creating an NFT auction, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>"
