excerpt: "<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>\n<p>Create a new listing for an asset on the NFT marketplace. The listing can be offered for the native blockchain assets (for example, ETH, MATIC, and so on) or for any fungible tokens.</p>\n<p>After the listing is created, <a href=\"https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Auction#operation/ApproveNftAuctionSpending\" target=\"_blank\">allow the marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset that you are selling</a>.</p>\n<p>You can create a listing only for an existing asset that you own (you must be the owner of the asset).</p>\n<p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BNB Smart Chain</li>\n<li>Celo</li>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Harmony</li>\n<li>Klaytn</li>\n<li>Polygon</li>\n<li>Solana (in <b>alpha</b>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>A known issue on Harmony</b><br/>\nOn Harmony, when you are viewing a transaction in the Harmony Blockchain Explorer, the transaction status may be displayed as the following:<br/>\n<code>Error reverted:x0</code><br/>\nThis is a known issue with the Harmony Blockchain Explorer. This status does not mean that the transaction failed. You can safely ignore it.</p>\n<p><b>The \"execution reverted\" message</b><br/>\nWhen making this API call, you may get the following message:<br/>\n<code>Although one or more Error Occurred [execution reverted] Contract Execution Completed</code><br/>\nThis message is a result of the marketplace version check and has no impact on completing the API call. You can safely ignore it.</p>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>\nWhen creating a new listing on the NFT marketplace, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>"
