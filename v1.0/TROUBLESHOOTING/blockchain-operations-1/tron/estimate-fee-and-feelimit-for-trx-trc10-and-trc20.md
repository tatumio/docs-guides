Transaction fees on the TRON network are calculated based on energy, bandwidth, and transaction type.

## How Tron fees are calculated

- **Normal TRX transactions** cost bandwidth points. Users can access the free daily bandwidth points (5000) or freeze their TRX to gain more. When bandwidth points arenâ€™t enough, TRX will be given directly from the sending account. Required TRX is the number of bytes \* 10 SUN. (1 TRX = 1,000,000 SUN).
- **Smart contracts** cost energy but need bandwidth points to broadcast and confirm the transaction. The bandwidth cost is the same as above.
- **Query transactions** are free since they donâ€™t cost energy or bandwidth.

## Sending TRC-10, TRC-20 (like Tether USDT), and "FAILED - Out of Energy"

Sending Tokens over the TRON network has a higher price in energy.

### Good to know

- Tron's latest [governance proposal](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/blob/master/tip-491.md) increased the price of energy.
- Make sure you have at least **50 TRX** on your available balance to pay for network fees.

> ðŸ“˜ The FeeLimit for TRC10 and TRC20 tokens over Tron is a [complex parameter to calculate](https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/issues/2982).

You can get an approximate idea about the `FeeLimit` via the following RPC query example:

```json cURL
curl --location 'https://api.tatum.io/v3/blockchain/node/tron-mainnet/wallet/getchainparameters' \
--header 'x-api-key:{Mainnet_API_KEY}'
//response:
{
    "chainParameter": [
        {
            "key": "getMaintenanceTimeInterval",
            "value": 21600000
        },
        {
            "key": "getAccountUpgradeCost",
            "value": 9999000000
        },
        {
            "key": "getCreateAccountFee",
            "value": 100000
        },
        {
            "key": "getTransactionFee", // The value we are looking for
            "value": 1000
        },
...
```
