When working with the TRON blockchain, you may encounter the "`tron.tx.expired`" error, indicating that the transaction has expired and cannot be broadcast after a specific timestamp.

The error occurs when a transaction is not broadcast within the specified expiration time:

- **The default TRON transaction expiration time is 60 seconds**.
- If the period between transaction creation and broadcast exceeds 60 seconds, the transaction is considered expired.

Example error:

```json JSON
"response": {
    "statusCode": 403,
    "errorCode": "tron.tx.expired",
    "message": "Transaction expired and cannot be broadcast after 1705324314000."
}
```

## Good to know

- KMS users need to be mindful of their configuration to check pending transactions at a rate below 60 seconds.
