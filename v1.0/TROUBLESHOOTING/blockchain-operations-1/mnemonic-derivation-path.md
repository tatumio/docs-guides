In blockchain technology, the **Derivation path** is a critical element of a wallet structure. The Derivation Path determines how exactly a wallet generates the XPUB, addresses, and Private Keys.

To generate the expected Blockchain Addresses and Private Keys, the **Derivation Path must match 1:1**. Blockchain Addresses generated via other services external to the Tatum API and or KMS may or may not match the expected Derivation Path. For example, Wallet services like [MetaMask use a different derivation path](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060331752).

> 📘 Tatum wallets use specific Mnemonic derivation paths per chain. These derivation paths are the same for API, SDKs, and KMS.
