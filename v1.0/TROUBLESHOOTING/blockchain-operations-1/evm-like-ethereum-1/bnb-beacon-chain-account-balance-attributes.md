BNB Beacon Chain Account balance comes with additional balance attributes

- **Available**: the amount of tokens that can be transferred, and spent to swap (buy) other assets
- **Locked**: the amount of tokens that has been used in any outstanding orders. Once the order terminates (either filled, canceled or expired), the locked amount will decrease.
- **Frozen**: the amount of tokens that has been frozen via Freeze transactions.
