## Good to know

You can encrypt your KMS wallets using one of the following ways:

1. Password-based encryption
2. [VGS](https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/) account that holds the encryption/decryption key
3. [MS Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) account that holds the encryption/decryption key
4. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account that holds the encryption/decryption key

Depending on which way you choose, you pass the relevant information in the environment variables or `.env` file. The most straightforward option is to encrypt the wallets with a password, but you're free to choose any of the options.
