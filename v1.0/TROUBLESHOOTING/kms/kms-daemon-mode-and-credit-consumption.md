KMS in Daemon mode periodically checks for pending transactions every 5 seconds by default, costing 4 credits per minute. This means 4 (credits) \_60 (minutes) \_24 (hours) == 5760 credits/day.

On top of that, there's a cost to sign transactions at a rate of x1 credit for every 500 txID signature attempts.

To lower the baseline credit consumption, you may increase the periodicity checks.

### Example:

```shell CLI
tatum-kms daemon --period=15
```
