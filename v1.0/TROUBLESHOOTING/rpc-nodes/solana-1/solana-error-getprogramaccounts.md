When making a complex call to a Solana RPC Node with the method `getProgramAccounts`, you may get an error looking as follows:

```json JSON
{
 "jsonrpc":"2.0",
 "error":{
  "code":-32010,
  "message":"Tokenkeg####### excluded from account secondary indexes; 
  this RPC method unavailable for key"
 },
 "id":1
}
```

From Solana Github, this error appears if a program is excluded from the secondary indices. [`Tokenkeg...`] with lots of accounts can be excluded from [`getProgramAccounts`] by RPC nodes as a consequence.
