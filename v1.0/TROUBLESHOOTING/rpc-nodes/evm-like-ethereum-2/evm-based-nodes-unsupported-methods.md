Tatum offers support for multiple chains and RPC nodes, allowing developers to interact with the blockchain network and perform various operations such as checking balances, submitting transactions, and more.

However, while Tatum supports a wide range of methods, there are a few that are not currently supported. The `personal` module methods are unsupported for Ethereum-based RPC nodes.
