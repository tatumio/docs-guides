The Harmony ONE explorer cannot display NFT tokens as of this article's writing.

Customers who mint NFT over Harmony ONE are encouraged to use an alternative Explorer or wallet service to see the NFT.

## Good to know

**MetaMask** is able to display NFT over Harmony ONE addresses. 

- **Mobile**: you should see NFT images.
- **Browser extension**: you should be able to see the token, but not the image. Look up for the trace inside the transaction: `-mintWithTokenURI( address : ### , uint256 : ###, string : https://##)`
