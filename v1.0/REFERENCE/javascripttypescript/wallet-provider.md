A browser wallet like MetaMask or Phantom is a service that allows users to interact with blockchain networks through their web browsers. These wallets enable users to manage their cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets in a non-custodial manner, meaning users have complete control over their private keys and funds.

Tatum SDK simplifies the process of connecting to browser-based non-custodial wallets like MetaMask without requiring developers to have in-depth knowledge of the specific wallet interfaces. By providing a streamlined and easy-to-use integration, Tatum SDK makes it more accessible for developers to build decentralised applications (dApps) that interact with various browser wallets.
