Tatum Key Management System (KMS) is a comprehensive solution for building custodial applications. In custodial applications, you control your applicationâ€™s end-usersâ€™ private keys and wallet mnemonics. Blockchain transactions are signed locally, and sensitive data is not sent over the Internet.

With KMS, you can easily build and scale custodial apps, provide the highest level of security for your users, and allow them to use blockchain technology without having to deal with private keys and mnemonics. End-users can simply log in to your app with their credentials, and KMS takes care of the rest.

# What does KMS do?

- KMS keeps mnemonics and private keys safe.
- KMS periodically pulls pending transactions to sign from Tatum Cloud, signs them locally using stored private keys, and broadcasts them to the blockchain.
