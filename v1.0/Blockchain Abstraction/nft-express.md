The Tatum platform already allows you to create your own NFTs on multiple blockchains without having to learn Solidity or create your own smart contracts. Anyone can create NFTS with just a few lines of code and mint NFTs in minutes.

However, to actually use NFTs and put them to work, mint them, for example, there are issues to consider before you start:

- **You must buy and hold crypto to pay for the gas fees.**  
  This can lead to regulatory difficulties for enterprises. Some banks may even freeze your account if you try to buy crypto.
- **You need to hold crypto on every blockchain on which you want to mint NFTs.**  
  This can be a logistical challenge when minting NFTs on a mass scale.
- **You need to deploy smart contracts to mint NFTs on each blockchain.**  
  This can be both complicated and expensive.
- **You need to deal with security issues with private keys to mint NFTs.**
- **You need to address performance issues**  
  Minting a single NFT is OK. But can you mint one million NFTs in 24 hours?
