Virtual accounts allow you to build an off-chain exchange type of ledger parallel to the blockchain and bypass the slow and often congested transaction mechanism of the blockchain itself. 

If your customers want to send their crypto outside of your application, they can withdraw it from their virtual account to their blockchain deposit addresses.
