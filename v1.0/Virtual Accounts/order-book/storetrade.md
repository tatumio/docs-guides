If there is trade already available to fill, fill as much trades as possible.<br/>\nIt is possible to charge fees for the trades. Fees are an extra amount on top of the trade amount and are paid in the currency that you going to block\ne.g.:\n- BUY BTC/USDT - fees will be paid in USDT\n- SELL BTC/ETH - fees will be paid in BTC\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf you fill type of the trade with FUTURE_BUY or FUTURE_SELL the trade will behave as a trade future. The trade is concluded now but will be fulfilled in future.\nThe date of fulfillment is by the “Seal Date” field. You can also block a percentage of the amount until the future trade has expired.\n</p>\n<p>Futures can also penalize contracting parties if they don’t have the agreed balance available in their accounts.\nThe penalty is calculated in the following way: Penalty amount = (Percentage of incomplete deal amount because of shortage from user) × (Maximum Penalty percentage of futures deal based on blocked amount and time interval) × (total blocked value).\n</p>\n<p>Example of the BTC/USDT trade future:</p>\n<p>The maker creates a sell with the following properties: 1 BTC at a price of 60000 USDT, with a blocking percentage of 22%, a penalty percentage of 45%, a system commision of 1% and with an expiration time of within 12 hours.</p>\n<pre>\n{\n  \"type\": \"FUTURE_SELL\",\n  \"price\": \"60000\",\n  \"amount\": \"1\",\n  \"pair\": \"BTC/USDT\",\n  \"currency1AccountId\": \"60a236db1b57f60d62612bf3\",\n  \"currency2AccountId\": \"609d0696bf835c241ac2920f\",\n  \"fee\": 1,\n  \"feeAccountId\": \"609d0696bf835c251ac2920a\",\n  \"attr\": {\n    \"sealDate\": 1621990960631,\n    \"percentBlock\": 22,\n    \"percentPenalty\": 45\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n\nThe taker accepts the offer with a buy and blocks 13200 USDT (60000 USDT × 0.22) in their account.\n<pre>\n{\n  \"type\": \"FUTURE_BUY\",\n  \"price\": \"60000\",\n  \"amount\": \"1\",\n  \"pair\": \"BTC/USDT\",\n  \"currency1AccountId\": \"60a236db1b57f60d62612bf2\",\n  \"currency2AccountId\": \"609d0696bf835c241ac2920a\",\n  \"attr\": {\n    \"sealDate\": 1621990960631,\n    \"percentBlock\": 22,\n    \"percentPenalty\": 45\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>At the time of the trade, the maker and taker have the following conditions.\nThe maker has 0.65 BTC (35% deficit) in their account and the taker has 49200 USDT (18% deficit) in their account.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe maker penalty is equal to 0.35 × 0.22 × (0.45 × 1 BTC) = 0.03465 BTC.\nThe taker penalty is equal to 0.18 × 0.22 × (0.45 × 60000 USDT) = 1069.2 USDT.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe system commission for the maker is 1 BTC × 1% = 0.01 BTC.\nThe system commission for the taker is 60000 USDT × 1% = 600 USDT.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe maker’s assets after deducting penalties and commissions equals 0.65 - 0.03465 - 0.01 = 0.60535 BTC. The taker’s assets after deducting penalties and commissions equals 49200 - 1069.2 - 600 = 47530.8 USDT.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe amount received by the maker after the trade is (0.60535 × 60000) + 1069.2 = 37390.2 USDT and the taker receives 0.60535 + 0.03465 = 0.64 BTC.\n</p>"
