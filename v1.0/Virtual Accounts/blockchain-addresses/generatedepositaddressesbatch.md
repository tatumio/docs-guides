excerpt: "<p><b>2 credits per API call + 1 credit for each created address<br/>\nOn Flow, additional 3000 credits are consumed for <a href=\"https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Flow#operation/FlowGenerateAddress\" target=\"_blank\">each created address</a>.</b></p>\n<p>Create multiple deposit addresses associated with a virtual account.</p>\n<p>When you have multiple deposit addresses created for the same virtual account, you aggregate various blockchain transactions from different addresses under a single account.<br/>You can deposit funds from another blockchain address to a deposit address associated with the virtual account, and the funds will be credited to that virtual account.</p>\n<p><b>Scanning for incoming deposits</b><br/>\nBy default, deposit addresses are scanned for incoming deposits. Deposit addresses are automatically synchronized with the associated virtual account, and you can see incoming deposits on the virtual account.<br/>Scanning deposit addresses for incoming deposits consumes <b>20 credits per address per day</b>.</p>\n<p>If you want to be notified about certain events occurring on the deposit addresses, <a href=\"https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Notification-subscriptions#operation/createSubscription\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe for notifications</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Virtual account cryptocurrency</b></p>\n<p>Depending on the cryptocurrency of the virtual account, this API generates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Public address</b> for BTC, BCH, ETH, or LTC</li>\n<li><b>DestinationTag</b> for XRP</li>\n<li><b>Message</b> for XLM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For fore information about supported blockchains and address types, see the <a href=\"https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Account#operation/createAccount\" target=\"_blank\">API for creating virtual accounts</a>.</p>\n<p>Deposit addresses are generated in the natural order of the extended public key provided in the virtual account. The derivation index is the representation of that order; it starts from 0 and ends at 2^31.</p>\n<p>When a new deposit address is generated, the last not used index is used to generate the address. You can skip some addresses to a different index, which means all the skipped addresses will no longer be used.</p>"
