excerpt: "<p><b>This method is deprecated.<br/>Use <a href=\"#operation/registerErc20Token\">this method</a> instead.</b></p><br/>\n<h4>2 credits per API call.</h4>\n<p>First step to create new ERC20 token with given supply on Ethereum blockchain with support of Tatum's private ledger.<br/>\nThis method only creates Tatum Private ledger virtual currency with predefined parameters. It will not generate any blockchain smart contract.<br/>\nThe whole supply of ERC20 token is stored in the customer's newly created account. Then it is possible to create new Tatum accounts with ERC20 token name as account's currency.<br/>\nNewly created account is frozen until the specific ERC20 smart contract address is linked with the Tatum virtual currency, representing the token.<br/>\nOrder of the steps to create ERC20 smart contract with Tatum private ledger support:\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#operation/registerErc20Token\">Create ERC20 token</a> - creates a virtual currency within Tatum</li>\n<li><a href=\"#operation/EthDeployErc20Blockchain\">Deploy ERC20 smart contract</a> - create new ERC20 smart contract on the blockchain</li>\n<li><a href=\"#operation/storeTokenAddress\">Store ERC20 smart contract address</a> - link newly created ERC20 smart contract address with Tatum virtual currency - this operation enables frozen account and enables ledger synchronization for ERC20 Tatum accounts</li>\n</ol>\nThere is a helper method <a href=\"#operation/EthDeployErc20\">Deploy Ethereum ERC20 Smart Contract to Blockchain and Ledger</a>, which wraps first 2 steps into 1 method.<br/>\nAddress on the blockchain, where all initial supply will be transferred, can be defined via the address or xpub and derivationIndex. When xpub is present, the account connected to this virtualCurrency will be set as the account's xpub.\n</p>"
