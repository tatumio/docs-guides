title: "Deploy a BNB Smart Chain BEP-20 smart contract to the blockchain and a virtual account"
slug: "bscdeploybep20"
excerpt: "<p><b>4 credits per API call</b></p>\n<p>Deploy a BNB Smart Chain BEP-20 smart contract. This is a helper method, which is combination of\n<a href=\"#operation/registerErc20Token\">Register new BEP20 token in the ledger</a> and <a href=\"https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Fungible-Tokens-(ERC-20-or-compatible)#operation/Erc20Deploy\">Deploy blockchain ERC20</a>.</p>\n<p>After deploying a contract to blockchain, the contract address will become available and must be stored within Tatum. Otherwise, it will not be possible to interact with it and starts automatic blockchain synchronization.</p>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>\nWhen deploying a BNB Smart Chain BEP-20 smart contract to the blockchain and a virtual account, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>"
