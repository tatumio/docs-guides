excerpt: "<p><b>This method is deprecated.<br/>Use <a href=\"#operation/registerErc20Token\">this method</a> instead.</b></p><br/>\n<h4>2 credits per API call.</h4>\n<p>First step to create new BEP20 token with given supply on BSC blockchain with support of Tatum's private ledger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis method only creates Tatum Private ledger virtual currency with predefined parameters. It will not generate any blockchain smart contract.<br/>\nThe whole supply of BEP20 token is stored in the customer's newly created account. Then it is possible to create new Tatum accounts with BEP20 token name as account's currency.<br/>\nNewly created account is frozen until the specific BEP20 smart contract address is linked with the Tatum virtual currency, representing the token.<br/>\nOrder of the steps to create BEP20 smart contract with Tatum private ledger support:\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#operation/registerErc20Token\">Register BEP20 token</a> - creates a virtual currency within Tatum</li>\n<li><a href=\"#operation/BscDeployErc20Blockchain\">Deploy BEP20 smart contract</a> - create new BEP20 smart contract on the blockchain</li>\n<li><a href=\"#operation/storeTokenAddress\">Store BEP20 smart contract address</a> - link newly created BEP20 smart contract address with Tatum virtual currency - this operation enables frozen account and enables ledger synchronization for BEP20 Tatum accounts</li>\n</ol>\nThere is a helper method <a href=\"#operation/EthDeployErc20\">Deploy BSC BEP20 Smart Contract to Blockchain and Ledger</a>, which wraps first 2 steps into 1 method.<br/>\nAddress on the blockchain, where all initial supply will be transferred, can be defined via the address or xpub and derivationIndex. When xpub is present, the account connected to this virtualCurrency will be set as the account's xpub.\n</p>"
