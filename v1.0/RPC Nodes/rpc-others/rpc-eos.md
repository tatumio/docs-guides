EOSIO's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) API allows developers to interact with the EOS blockchain. The RPC API provides a set of HTTP endpoints for querying blockchain data, managing blockchain nodes, interacting with smart contracts, and performing other operations on the EOS blockchain. The EOSIO RPC API is typically well-documented and designed to be user-friendly for developers.
