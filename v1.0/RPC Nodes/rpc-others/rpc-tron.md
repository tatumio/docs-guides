Tron RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is an essential tool for developers looking to interact with the Tron blockchain network. It provides a standardised interface for communication, enabling developers to retrieve data, send transactions, deploy smart contracts, and more. Tron RPC plays a vital role in building decentralised applications, integrating blockchain functionality, and exploring the possibilities offered by the Tron network.&#x20;
