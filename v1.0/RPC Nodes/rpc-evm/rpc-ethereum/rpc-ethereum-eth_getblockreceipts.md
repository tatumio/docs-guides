## Overview

`eth_getBlockReceipts` RPC method is a powerful tool for retrieving the receipts of all transactions included in a block, along with the block header. This method is particularly useful for applications that require detailed information about transactions, such as event logs, gas usage, and the status of transactions. It is supported on nodes running the Erigon client.

## Parameters

 `eth_getBlockReceipts` method takes a single parameter: the block identifier. This can be a block number (in hex format), a block hash, or one of the special strings "latest" or "earliest". The block identifier specifies which block's transaction receipts you want to retrieve. For example, to get the receipts for the latest block, you would use "latest" as the parameter.

## Returns

The response from `eth_getBlockReceipts` includes an array of transaction receipt objects, each containing detailed information about a transaction. Key fields in the response include:
