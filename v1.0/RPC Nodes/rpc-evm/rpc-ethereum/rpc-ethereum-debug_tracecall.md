## Overview

`debug_traceCall` is an Ethereum RPC method that allows you to execute a given call (message), tracing the steps of its execution. This can be helpful for developers and auditors who want to inspect and analyze the internal operations and state changes of a contract call without modifying the blockchain state. This method can assist in debugging and identifying potential issues with contract execution, as well as understanding how gas is consumed during the execution of a call.

## Parameters

### 1. Transaction call object (required)

`object` - The eth_call data

| Name     | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------- | :------ | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| from     | string  | no       | The address the transaction is sent from                                                                                                                                       |
| to       | string  | yes      | The address the transaction is directed to                                                                                                                                     |
| gas      | integer | no       | The integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. Although eth_call consumes zero gas, this parameter may still be needed by some executions.                     |
| gasPrice | integer | no       | The integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas                                                                                                                             |
| value    | integer | no       | The integer of the value sent with this transaction                                                                                                                            |
| data     | string  | no       | The hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. Additional information is available at [Ethereum Contract ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.0/abi-spec.html) |

### 2. Block parameter (required)

- hexadecimal block number
- block hash
- The `Tag` "latest", "earliest", "pending", "safe" or "finalized" "Safe" and "finalized" are only available on Ethereum and Arbitrum One chain. [Ethereum documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).

### 3. Trace type (optional)

- ` The type of tracer` - String - It might be `callTracer` or `prestateTracer`
  - `callTracer` - The calltracer keeps track of all call frames, including depth 0 calls, that are made during a transaction.
  - `prestateTracer` - The prestateTracer replays the transaction and tracks every part of state that occured during the transaction.
- `tracerConfig` - The object to specify the configurations of the tracer
  - `onlyTopCall` - When set to true, this will only trace the primary (top-level) call and not any sub-calls. It eliminates the additional processing for each call frame.

#### Additional configuration parameters

- `disableStorage` â€” when enabled, it prevents tracing of storage changes made by the transaction being analyzed, which can reduce the resource requirements of the analysis. By default, debug_traceTransaction traces both memory and storage changes, but storage tracing can be particularly resource-intensive, especially for large transactions.
- `disableStack` â€” when enabled, it skips tracing of stack changes made by the transaction being analyzed.
- `disableMemory` â€” when true, it stops tracing of memory changes made by the transaction being analyzed, reducing resource requirements.
- `disableReturnData` â€” when true, it prevents the method from tracing the return data of a transaction. This return data tracing can be very demanding on resources, as it requires a lot of time and processing power.
- `timeout` (default: 5s) â€” allows to customize the method's timeout period for JavaScript-based tracing calls.

> ðŸš§ When using a tracer type , `disableMemory`, `disableStorage`, `disableStack`, or `disableReturnData` will not have any effect. When no tracer is selected, the response defaults to [Struct/opcode logger](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/evm-tracing/built-in-tracers#structopcode-logger).
