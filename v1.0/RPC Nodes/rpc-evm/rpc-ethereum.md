Ethereum RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a powerful tool for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain network. It provides developers with a standardised interface to communicate with the Ethereum network, enabling them to retrieve data, send transactions, deploy smart contracts, and more. With Ethereum RPC, developers can build decentralised applications, integrate blockchain functionality into existing systems, and explore the vast ecosystem of Ethereum.
