Optimism RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a powerful tool for interacting with the Optimism blockchain network. It provides developers with a standardised interface to communicate with the Ethereum network, enabling them to retrieve data, send transactions, deploy smart contracts, and more. With Optimism RPC, developers can build decentralised applications, integrate blockchain functionality into existing systems, and explore the vast ecosystem of Optimism.
