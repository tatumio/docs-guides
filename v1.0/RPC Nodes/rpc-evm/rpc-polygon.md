Polygon RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a crucial tool for developers looking to interact with the Polygon blockchain network. It provides a standardised interface for communication, allowing developers to retrieve data, send transactions, deploy smart contracts, and more. With Polygon RPC, developers can build decentralised applications, integrate blockchain functionality, and explore the diverse ecosystem of Polygon.
