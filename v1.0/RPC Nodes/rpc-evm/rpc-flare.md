Flare RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a powerful tool for interacting with the Flare blockchain network. It provides developers with a standardised interface to communicate with the Flare network, enabling them to retrieve data, send transactions, deploy smart contracts, and more. With Flare RPC, developers can build decentralised applications, integrate blockchain functionality into existing systems, and explore the vast ecosystem of Flare.
